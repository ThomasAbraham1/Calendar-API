This discounted price reflects our commitment to building a long-term partnership with you.\n\nWe understand that you're currently paying significantly less than $50 (Romanian equivalent) for your existing PMS and POS system. While our pricing is competitive and offers far superior functionality and support, we understand that cost is a key consideration.\n\nIf the above pricing doesn't meet your budgetary requirements, we'd appreciate it if you could provide us with an invoice or other documentation detailing your current monthly costs for both your PMS and POS systems.  This information will help us better understand your current situation and explore whether we can create a more suitable pricing structure.  Providing this information will allow us to potentially adjust our pricing to better align with your needs.\n\nWe are confident that Easy InnKeeping offers a substantial upgrade in terms of features, reliability, and support compared to your current solution.  We look forward to hearing from you and discussing how we can best serve your needs.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThomas Abraham\n\nGraceSoft Sales Team\n\n713-981-5300 x 100\n"
